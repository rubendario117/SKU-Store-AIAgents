## 🔍 Monitoring & Operations

### Dashboard Access
```bash
# Start monitoring dashboard
streamlit run monitoring/dashboard.py
```
Access at: `http://localhost:8501`

### Key Monitoring Metrics
- **System Overview**: Success rates, operation counts, active operations
- **Agent Performance**: Per-agent success rates and duration analysis  
- **Failure Analysis**: Recent failures with error categorization
- **Performance Trends**: Historical data over multiple time periods

### Log Files Location
```
logs/
├── main.log                 # Main application logs
├── main_structured.jsonl   # JSON structured logs
├── main_errors.log         # Critical errors only
├── image_agent.log         # Image sourcing logs
├── vehicle_agent.log       # Vehicle applications logs  
└── bigcommerce_agent.log   # BigCommerce upload logs
```

## 🚨 Production Monitoring

### Health Checks
- [ ] **Monitor success rates** via dashboard
- [ ] **Check error logs** daily for critical issues  
- [ ] **Validate API quotas** not being exceeded
- [ ] **Disk space monitoring** for log files and images
- [ ] **Performance threshold alerts** configured

### Maintenance Tasks
- [ ] **Weekly log cleanup** to prevent disk space issues
- [ ] **Monthly cache clearing** to ensure fresh data parsing
- [ ] **API key rotation** as per security policy
- [ ] **Performance baseline updates** based on historical data

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- **SerpAPI**: Monitor usage against daily/monthly quotas
- **Google APIs**: Cloud Translation and Gemini have usage limits
- **BigCommerce API**: Respect rate limiting to avoid throttling

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: Large batches may require increased memory allocation
- **Disk Space**: Image downloads and logs require monitoring
- **Network**: High bandwidth usage during image sourcing phases

### Data Quality Dependencies
- **Official website availability**: Parsing depends on source site stability
- **Image source reliability**: Quality depends on availability of official images
- **Translation accuracy**: Dependent on Google Translate service quality

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues occur in production:

1. **Stop processing**: Kill running batch processes
2. **Revert to previous version**: 
   ```bash
   git checkout [previous-stable-commit]
   ```
3. **Clear problematic cache**: Delete vehicle_applications_cache.json
4. **Restart with reduced batch size**: Lower MAX_PRODUCTS_TO_PROCESS_IN_BATCH
5. **Monitor closely**: Use dashboard to track recovery

## 📋 Post-Deployment Actions

### Immediate (Day 1)
- [ ] **Deploy to production environment**
- [ ] **Run initial batch** with small sample (5-10 products)
- [ ] **Verify monitoring dashboard** shows correct data
